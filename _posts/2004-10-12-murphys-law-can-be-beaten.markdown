[Murphy's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) has been [expressed mathematically](http://www.news.com.au/common/printpage/0,6093,11009375,00.html) as



    
    
    <code>((U+C+I) x (10-S))/20 x A x 1/(1-sin(F/10))</code>
    






  * U for urgency


  * C for complexity


  * I for importance


  * S for skill


  * F for frequency


  * A for aggravation





So now, I know how to beat it!  

No bad luck anymore... ;-)
