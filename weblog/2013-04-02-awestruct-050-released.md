[Awestruct][awestruct] is the static web site generator I use for my Web site.

This 0.5.0 release is a big one which simplifies rendering by using [Tilt][tilt] and provides an [Amazon S3 deployer][s3] (that I contributed) out of the box among other other features.

I upgraded this morning and it worked like a charm.
