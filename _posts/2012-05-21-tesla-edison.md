Interesting back and forth about the relative merits of [Nikola Tesla][tesla] and [Thomas Edison][edison]

1. [the original comics from the Oatmeal][comics]
2. [the critics from Forbes][forbes]
3. [the response from the Oatmeal][response]

The Oatmeal draws cartoons; exaggeration comes with the territory. 

I don't know a lot about Tesla and it's hard to separate the myths from the facts but this debate made me eager to learn more about him and make my own opinion about these two great engineers.
