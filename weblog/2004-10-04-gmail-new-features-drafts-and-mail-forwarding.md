<p>Google has updated Gmail and added a few features such as inline contacts and atom feed (<a href="http://blog.codefront.net/archives/2004/10/04/gmails-new-features-atom-feed/">more details</a>).</p>
<p>On my account I saw two other great features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the ability to save drafts</li>
  <li>mail forwarding</li>
</ul>
<p>Drafts saving was a feature I was eagerly expecting (I've been bitten too much times writing a mail in Gmail and accidentally closing the tab...)</p>
