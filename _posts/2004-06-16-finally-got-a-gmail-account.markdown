Today, I've received an invitation for a [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) account (thanks to my account on [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)).





It's too early to tell if I'll switch to it to replace my other webmail but right now, I'm really impressed by it and it lives up to the hype it generated...  

It's the first I use a web application like a desktop application.





Congrats to the google guys!
