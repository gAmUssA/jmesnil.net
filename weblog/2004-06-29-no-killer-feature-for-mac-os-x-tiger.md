Apple previewed yesterday [Mac OS X Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/). I haven't watched the keynote but from the description, it does not contain a killer feature like [Expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/) for Mac OS X Panther.  

The enhanced search engine, [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/spotlight.html), or [Safari RSS](http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/safari.html) may be interesting but I don't think it is worth the price of Tiger when it is released.  

All in all, that is a good thing that there is nothing I want badly from Tiger: I just got my PowerBook with Panther and I'd prefer to skip a release of Mac OS X. I'll keep my bucks for Mac OS X.5 (whatever its name is!).
