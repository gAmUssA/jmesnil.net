[Heroku][heroku] explains why they have added [Clojure][clojure] support in addition to [Ruby][ruby] and [node.js][nodejs]:

> Ruby, Javascript, and Clojure are all general-purpose languages, but they each excel at certain use cases. Ruby's highly dynamic nature and emphasis on beauty makes it a natural fit for user-facing web apps. Node.js's evented concurrency makes it a great fit for the realtime web. Clojure covers a new use case on the Heroku platform: components which demand correctness, performance, composability; and optionally, access to the Java ecosystem.

The right tool for the right job.  
More choice for the tool helps get the job done simpler and faster.
