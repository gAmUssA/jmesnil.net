**Update** (Oct., 1st): A huge thank you to everyone that has mailed, phoned, or linked to me over the past several weeks. I was contacted by great people at companies with very interesting and cool things and it was a tough decision to choose among all these great offers.  

But I finally took the decision and starting today I'm working for [Red Hat][rh] in the [JBoss][jboss] division. 

<strike>
It is now official: I've been notified by my employer of my layoff (French R&D; office closing down, cost reduction and all).

The good news is that I'll have more time to work on [jmx4r][jmx4r] and [eclipse-jmx][e-jmx] and publish articles on this weblog.  
But, as fun as it sounds, it won't pay the bills, so I need to find a new job.

Please hire [me][me].

If you are unable to hire me, please do me a favor and link to this entry. 

My resume is available in [PDF][cv-pdf] or [Word][cv-word].
</strike>

Thank you.
