After hiring [Werner Vogels](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) has now hired [Pat Helland](http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/).  

Amazon really has a A-list of people who know distributed systems from the inside and I'm eagerly waiting too see what is coming out of it.
