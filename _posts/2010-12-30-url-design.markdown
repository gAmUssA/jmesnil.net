[GitHub][github] URLs are a good example to imitate. I often edit them directly to switch from one project to another.

It is painful to see how some Web sites are not bothered by their ugly URLs.   
Don't get me started on the URLs generated by some Web frameworks. I suspect they are ugly on purpose so that you can know which framework is used by a Web site just by looking at its URLs.

[In the beginning was the command line][cli], and then came the address bar...
