This site is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Jekyll Bootstrap][jb].

I tried to achieve a design that works great both displaying photos and code. I also wanted to have it display correctly on smartphones and tablets. I started from the design of [Mark Reid][mreid] site and mixed it with elements from [James Duncan Davidson][dd]'s to make it friendlier to photos. 

Everything that looks great on my site is theirs, the rest is my own little contribution.
