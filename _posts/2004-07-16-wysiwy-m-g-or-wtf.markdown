The new WYSIWY - M - G editor of [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) is a hell to use when posting html + JavaScript code (like in my [previous blog](http://www.jmesnil.net/weblog/2004/07/bookmarklet-to-split-html-document.html)). It also doesn't work well on Firefox and doesn't work at all on Safari.




What's worse is that it change the HTML I type when I edit again the same post. That'd be great if the HTML editor could be set by default.




**[update]** The [new version of the editor](http://status.blogger.com/status.blogger/2004/07/weve-just-pushed-another-update-to.asp) pushed by Jason is working fine and keeps the HTML version by default. Thanks Jason!
