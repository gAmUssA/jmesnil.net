That's a good idea from the expert group to release an early draft for JavaOne.




I now have an answer for my  [Message-Driven Beans question](http://www.jmesnil.net/weblog/2004/06/message-driven-beans-in-ejb-30.html): they won't change.




One remark on the draft, it's a good idea to put in it only what has changed since EJB 2.1 because it makes it a quick read (93 pages) and helps to diff. But I hope that in the next release of the specification, they will put everything in it so that we don't have to refer to the EJB 2.1 specification sections. There are 2 pages about Message-Driven Beans in the EJB 3.0 spec which references 20 pages in the EJB 2.1 spec! ;-)
