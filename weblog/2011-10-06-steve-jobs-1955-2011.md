[Steve Jobs][stanford]:

> Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma &mdash; which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

For all the products and ideas that Steve Jobs delivered during his life, nothing from him has inspired me more than when he talked about life, love and death and what we can do from our life in his Stanford commencement speech:

All my thoughts go to his family, friends and coworkers at Pixar & Apple.
