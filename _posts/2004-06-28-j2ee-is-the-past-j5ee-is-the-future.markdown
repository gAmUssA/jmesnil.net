Apparently, Sun will change the version number of Java [to 5.0 with Tiger](http://news.com.com/Sun+opens+some+Java+source+code/2100-7344_3-5248590.html?tag=nefd.top). But it seems that they'll keep the name J2SE and J2EE.  

It reminded me of a good laugh I had with a thread on TheServerSide.com about [J3EE](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=23403) and the related [bileblog](http://www.jroller.com/page/fate/?anchor=j3ee_is_moron_bait).




Maybe Sun and the JCP will suprise anybody by going directly to J5SE and J5EE... Imagine all the consequences:






  * Who would care about J2EE compliance, J5EE compliance is the way to go


  * if J3EE would have been all about lightweight containers and aspects, what could be J5EE?


  * Why EJB 3.0? I want my EJB 5.0 (but they'll have to be backwards compatible to version 1.0)!


  * All the J3EE proponents will look so passe...




Seriously though, I think it's a good idea to update the major version number of Java but it'd be a good idea to also remove the **2** number from Java **2** Standard and Enterprise Edition. I'd prefer a Java Enterprise Edition 1.5 rather than explaining that the J**2**EE version 1.5 is dependent of Java language in version 5.0.
