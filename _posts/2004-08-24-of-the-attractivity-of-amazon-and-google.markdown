Yesterday I read [Werner Vogels's weblog](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/). I had the opportunity to meet and talk to Werner at [HPTS'03](http://research.sun.com/hpts2003/) and consider him one of the finest people to learn from for anything related to distributed computing. He was recently hired by [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) and in his [weblog](http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000500.html) he explains why he accepted to work for Amazon instead of a company such as [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/).  

His analysis is spot on and describes why companies such as [Google](http://www.google.com/) or Amazon offer such interesting challenges compared to traditional software companies like Microsoft, [Sun](http://www.sun.com) or [BEA](http://www.bea.com/). It explains why some of the top software people and most prominent figure of the IT field (Adam Bosworth and Joshua Bloch to name a few) left "traditional" software companies for these internet application companies.  

I'm currently on a mission for a big internet company and I totally share his point of view. The scale and range of such applications is just so challenging and completely different from the various middleware projects I was previously involved in.




As I wrote this blog, I just saw that [Cédric Beust](http://www.beust.com/weblog/) has also [left BEA for Google](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000172.html). Congratulations Cédric!
