Could it be a good idea to develop a [CRC Card](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CrcCard)-based whiteboard with [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org) and [XBL](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xbl/xbl.html) (similar to the [sticky note example](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/xbl/test5/test.html))?  

It may be interesting to use it similarly to a Wiki to share design information simply.
I made a quick search for such a Firefox extension but I found nothing.




Is it worth it?
