I often make the same search queries in [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com) (e.g. give me all the mails I sent to a specific mailing list). Unfortunately, these queries are not kept by Gmail and you have to type them everytime.  

But I found a simple way to make Gmail remember them.


So, if you want to access Gmail queries directly from its search field history, you just have to search for them on [Google](http://www.google.com) (provided you have the Google cookie).  

Since Gmail seach field kept the history of your Google searches, they will be available next time you search mails in Gmail.
