I just received my copy of [Cocoa Programming](http://pragprog.com/titles/dscpq/cocoa-programming). At first glance, the book seems a good update for Mac OS X development.

It has been quite a few months since I did Mac (and iPhone) programming. I have not looked deeply at [Core Data](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/CoreData/cdProgrammingGuide.html) and [Grand Central Dispatch](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html) yet. I also want to experiment with Objective-C blocks.

I need to find a suitable idea for a Mac application to prototype and experiment. Any idea or suggestion is welcome!
