There's a lot going on related to asynchronous stuff in Java.






  * Java 1.5 and its [concurrent collection](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-tiger06164.html)


  * IBM and its [Asynchronous IO for Java](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/aio4j?Open&ca=daw-hp-pr)


  * ActiveMQ and its [RESTful API](http://activemq.codehaus.org/REST)




I expect to see a new breed of message bus which leverages all this stuff and others (e.g. NIO) to provide the core infrastructure to build <buzzword>SOA</buzzword> applications.
