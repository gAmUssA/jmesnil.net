That's the joy to work for a service company: every new mission brings new surprises...





While my latest mission was in a brick and mortar company, I've started today to work for a young successful startup.
What's surprised me is that the brick and mortar company was more up to date wrt web and Java technology than the startup!  

But the problematic of that company is quite huge and they can't afford to play with latest technology: they have to keep their legacy code and make it work 24/7.





Part of my job'll be to update the technology they used without interfering on the production. The fun begins now!
