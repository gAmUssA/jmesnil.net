After [Innobase](http://www.innodb.com/), [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com) [has bought](http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-6039070.html?part=rss&tag=6039070&subj=news) [Sleepycat](http://www.sleepycat.com/), the maker of the great database engine [BerkeleyDB](http://www.sleepycat.com/products/bdb.html).
Congratulations to the Sleepycat team!

As an aside, Oracle now owns the developers of InnoDB and BDB, two of the most popular transactional
table formats used by [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com) database.  
Shouldn't [MySQL AB](http://www.mysql.com) start to worry about that?
