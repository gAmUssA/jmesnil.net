[Red Hat][redhat] rightly deserves this award with all the innovative Java projects managed by its middleware division [JBoss][jboss].

Congratulations to all Red Hat developers who drive this innovation with a special attention to my ex-teamates on [HornetQ][hornetq] who are doing a tremendous work on the best and fastest messaging service :)
