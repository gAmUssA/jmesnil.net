I just saw today new features for [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us).
Users can sort tags by frequency or alphabetic order, display them as a list or a cloud and more interestingly regroup them as bundles (all thes features are available at the bottom of your tag lists. Since I start to have a long list of tags I didn't see these features until today where I scrolled down to the bottom of my bookmarks page).

The two more interesting features are the cloud display where all your tags are displayed as a single paragraph with font sizes and colors showing which are the most frequent. Very useful visual clue and I no longer need to scroll down to click on my [xml](http://http://del.icio.us/jmesnil/xml) tag: it remains at the top of the page.

The other great feature is the bundles where I can regroup similar tags in a tree hierarchy. For example, I've regrouped all the tags corresponding to people I read about in a `people` bundle. (see [my del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/jmesnil) page). That's another way to organize my bookmarks without having to clutter my bookmarks with tags which are semantically not interesting (e.g. `people`) but are used only to sort my bookmarks.

Kudos to del.icio.us developers for making their service even more useful and usable.
