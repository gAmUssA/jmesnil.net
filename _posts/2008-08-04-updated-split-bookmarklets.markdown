I was doing some house-cleaning on my weblog after upgrading Wordpress and redesigning its presentation (in a [minimalist][diveintomark] but [not so minimalist][tomayko] fashion) when I saw that my popular [split bookmarklets][split-bookmarklets] were broken due to a bad formatting.

I have fixed them and checked that they work correctly with Firefox 3, Safari 3 and WebKit nightly builds (my preferred browser these days) but I have not checked if they work on IE and Opera. If you can test on these browsers, let me know if they work.
