The main reason of the lack of posts on this weblog was released yesterday: [JBoss Messaging 2.0 Beta is out][jbm]. JBoss Messaging is a [JMS][jms] messaging provider that is included in [JBoss Middleware stacks][jboss].

It has been a wild ride and a great team effort to release it. Onward to the final 2.0 release now!
