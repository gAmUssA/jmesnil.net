I've just released [eclipse-jmx 0.2.0][e-jmx].

See [what's new & noteworthy][nw] and the [release notes][rn].  
You can [download it][zip] or update it from Eclipse using the [update site][update-site]. 

One word of caution: it is still in alpha stage and nowhere near as functional or usable as [jconsole][jconsole].
Having said that, I hope it can still be useful.

Do not hesitate to send feedback on the [dev mailing list][dev-ml] or to create issues in its [tracker][tracker] if you encounter a bug.

Enjoy!
