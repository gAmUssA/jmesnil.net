> The X was growing on me. I was walking the streets of a new place with two cameras and three lenses and never once tired of carrying this gear. It was hanging on my side or in a pocket. The weight of all of it was distributed around my person and I never felt it. No tired neck. No sore shoulder. Kick ass image quality. Lens choices. As long as I was methodical in my shooting the camera, and all of its quirks and laggy issues, were beginning to fade away.

I am searching  for a camera with good image quality that I can bring with me anywhere (my DSL is too big for that).
I like the X-Pro 1's retro look, its size seems adequate and the IQ is outstanding:

The Fuji X-Pro 1 is a tempting camera...
