I received [Joe McNally][mcnally]'s [Sketching Light][sketching]. It is a gorgeous book full of nuggets to learn more about lighting a scene.

I prefer to take pictures with available light as I find the flash too intrusive. However this book makes me eager to experiment more: the possibilities offered by flashes open a whole new world of images.
