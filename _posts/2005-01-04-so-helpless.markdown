The tsunami in Asia is a tragedy. It became even more so when I learnt that someone I knew and his family were among the victims.  

[Denis Caromel](http://www-sop.inria.fr/oasis/personnel/Denis.Caromel/) is an [ObjectWeb](http://www.objectweb.org/) fellow. I had the pleasure to meet him and talk to him at several ObjectWeb meetings and he is a really nice guy.




He and his family were in holidays in Sri Lanka when the tsunami occurred. He is safe in an hospital but his wife and their two children are still missing.  

I feel so helpless and there is nothing I can do to help him but raise attention to **[this link](http://www.labri.fr/Perso/~chaumett/attalicaromel/)** where you can find pictures of his wife and children and a map of their location in Sri Lanka.
