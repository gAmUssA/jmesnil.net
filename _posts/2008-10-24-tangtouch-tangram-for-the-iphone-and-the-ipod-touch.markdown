[TangTouch][tangtouch] is now available on the [App Store][tangtouch-itunes].  
It is a [Tangram][tangram] puzzle game for the iPhone or the iPod Touch.

I wrote this game as a way to learn more about Objective-C and Mac/iPhone development.
The bulk of the application was written [months ago][iphone-sdk] but I waited until I had an iPhone 3G to finish it and test it _in situ_.

It's a very simple game but I find it quite fun to play (being the author, it's possible I'm biased...) 

I released 2 versions:

* a [commercial version][tangtouch-itunes] with more than 200 puzzles
* a [free version][tangtouch-lite-itunes] with 32 puzzles

This way you can download the free version with no strings attached. And if you like it, you can buy the commercial version.
