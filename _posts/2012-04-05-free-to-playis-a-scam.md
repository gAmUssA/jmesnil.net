[Notch][notch] (of [Minecraft][minecraft] fame) talking about its next game [Ox10c][0x10c]:

I don't understand the economics behind [Free-to-play][f2p]. I don't want to play games that cost even more through in-app purchases or which display ads.

I have not warmed up to Minecraft but I am looking forward to this game. Hard science fiction and duct tape: what's not to love!
