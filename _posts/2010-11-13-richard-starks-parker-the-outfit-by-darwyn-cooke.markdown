I just received the [hardcover of "The Outfit"][amazon] and it looks like another amazing noir comic from one of my favourite comic artist, [Darwyn Cooke][cooke].

The previous book, ["The Hunter"][hunter], was the best comic I read in 2009 right after David Mazzucchelli's [Asterios Polyp][asterios].  
I expect "The Outfit" to be just as riveting or even better.
