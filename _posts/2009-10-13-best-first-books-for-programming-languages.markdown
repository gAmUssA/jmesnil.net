As a followup to my previous entry, this is the list of _first_ books I wholly recommend to learn programming languages:




  C
      [K & R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book))
  Clojure
      [Programming Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure)
  Erlang
      [Programming Erlang](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/index.html)
  JavaScript
      [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748)
  Lisp
      [The Little Schemer](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/)
  Objective-C
      [Cocoa Programming with Mac OS X](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321503619/bignerdranch-20) 1
  Python
      [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.org/) 2
  Ruby
      [Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why's_(poignant)_Guide_to_Ruby)
  Smalltalk
      [Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X)


These books are not necessarily the most complete references and they do not cover all features offered by the languages but I found that they gave me the best insight to understand and think with these languages.

One language I did not list is Java. I have used Java for so long that the last introduction book I read was for version 1.2. Which book would you recommend to learn Java?

1.  This is more than just Objective-C but I found that learning Cocoa stuff really make the language shine. ↩
2.  I have not read [Dive into Python 3](http://diveintopython3.org/) yet but I bet it is as good or even better than Dive into Python ↩
