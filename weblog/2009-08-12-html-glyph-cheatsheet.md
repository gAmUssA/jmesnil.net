I don't often need HTML glyphs apart from the usual suspects (&amp;amp; for &, &amp;lt; for <, etc.) but when I need to find a specific one, I always waste time finding it again.

I found a  [good reference][encoding] which lists all the glyphs. However it is slow to load all the glyphs and the default font size is too slow to see the details of the glyphs. I need to increase the text size (and reload the whole page) several times to have a better look at the glyphs, making it really slow.

I finally decided to have my own [cheatsheet][cheatsheet] to reference the glyphs I sometimes need (and some I may use one day...).   
I will never waste time again to find the Command key âŒ˜ (&amp;#8984;).
