> Well there was a time when you let me know  

What's really going on below  

But now you never show that to me do ya  

But remember when I moved in you  

And the holy dove was moving too  

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  

  

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah




I like the original one from Leonard Cohen but Jeff Buckley's version is closer to my heart.
