Now that the release date is known (April 29th), and after having browsed the[ 200+ new features of Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/), these are the ones I'm looking forward to:



        
  * [Spotlight](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/) -- I'm using [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) for some of the Spotlight features but Spotlight integration in Apple applications (especially Mail) seems quite powerful

        
  * [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/) -- Widgets are cool (but are they useful?). What is interesting with Dashboard is that it's [based on Web standards](http://developer.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). If it is possible to use an XmlHttpRequest object from Dashboard widgets, there is a lot of potential (a new wave of Web Services straight to my desktop)

	
  * Preview -- View and create annotations to a PDF document

        
  * DVD Player -- Bookmark favorite moments of a DVD

        
  * iChat AV -- Jabber support

        
  * Mail -- Add photos from Mail directly to iPhoto

        
  * Mobility -- More battery usage for my PowerBook

        
  * Access Spotlight from a UNIX command line using `mdls` or `mdfind` (will it be more powerful than `find/grep/locate` combination?)

        
  * Java 1.5 -- it seems it's not part of Tiger but available as a separate download



There is no killer feature for me (like [Expose](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/) was for Panther) but a lot of minor enhancements which should improve the great user experience I have on my Mac so far.
