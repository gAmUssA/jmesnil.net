My colleague, Bill Burke, sums up why I enjoy so much writing Open Source software at Red Hat.

On a related news, [JRuby][jruby] core team members, Charles Nutter and Tom Enebo, [are moving to Red Hat][rubyinside].
I can't wait to see what it will bring to projects such as [Torquebox][torquebox] and [OpenShift][openshift].
