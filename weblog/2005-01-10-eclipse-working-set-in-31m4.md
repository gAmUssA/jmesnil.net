A cool new feature in [Eclipse 3.1M4](http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.1M4-200412162000/eclipse-news-part1-M4.html) is that you can organize projects by working sets.





I've got a lot of projects in my workspace which relates to different developments. My package explorer view is quite cluttered by dozens of fine-grained projects.  

To improve readibility, I created different working sets (one for each related development) and I show them (`Show > Working Sets`).  

When I focus on a particular development, I `Go Into` the specific working set and I only see the projects of this given working set.




Not groundbreaking but definitely useful.
