The guys at [hoopism.com](http://hoopism.com) have created interesting diagrams connecting for each NBA team the passer to the scorer.

From the diagram above, we can see that Tony Parker assists were mainly for Tim Duncan and Richard Jefferson, while Manu Ginobili distribution is more diversified (George Hill, Dejuan Blair and Antonio McDyess in addition to Duncan and Jefferson). 

As an aside, the diagrams at hoopism.com are drawn using a [Processing](http://processing.org/)-based Java applet. They are the single reason I activate Java Applets on my laptop...
