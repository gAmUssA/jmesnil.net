Congratulations to the [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org) guys for the [J2EE certification](http://www.infoworld.com/article/04/07/16/HNjbosscert_1.html). That's a Very Good Thing to see that Open Source projects get certified. with [JOnAS](http://jonas.objectweb.org) and [Geronimo](http://geronimo.apache.org/) certifications coming soon, the J2EE market could be shaken up.




That's great because it'll bring innovation (EJB3) from both the Open Source and the proprietary stack (BEA, IBM, Oracle) under the stewardship of the JCP. It'll also increase choice which is also a Very Very Good Thing.  

When I see people on [TheServerSide](http://www.theserverside.com/) complaining that there is too much choice in Java (Hibernate or JDO, Ant or Maven, JBoss or Weblogic, ...), it reminds me of my use of Emacs and Vi. I'm very happy to be able to use one tool or the other for a given task and not to be bound to an inadequate tool.
