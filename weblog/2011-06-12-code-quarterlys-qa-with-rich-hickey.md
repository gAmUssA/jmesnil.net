A very interesting interview of the creator of [Clojure][clojure], Rich Hickey, by Michael Fogus, the co-author of [Joy of Clojure][joy]<a id="fnr1-2011-06-12" href="#fn1-2011-06-12"><sup>1</sup></a>.

If you appreciate this interview, Rich's [talk about Value, Identity and State][qcon] is a must-see for anybody interested in computing and software languages (no knowledge of Lisp or Clojure is required).
