As explained by [John Gruber][daring-fireball-spaces], Apple has improved [Spaces][spaces] support in Mac OS X 10.5.3 but there are still some broken features.

When I'm reordering my windows, instinctively, I want to activate Spaces then use Expose `All Windows` feature to rearrange them. But this does not work: I have to first use Expose _then_ Spaces.

Before 10.5.3, it was not possible to use Expose when Spaces was active. Now, we can activate Spaces and then display `All Windows` in Expose using the screen corners or the keyboard's function keys:

However it still does not work using mouse keys.  
As for Expose `Application Windows`, it does not work at all when activating Spaces.

The behaviour I'm expecting from Spaces & Expose is to be able to switch between Expose features (`All Windows` _and_ `Application Windows`) and Spaces _in any order_ using either screen corners, function keys or _mouse keys_.

Maybe I'll have this behaviour in [Snow Leopard][snow-leopard]...
