Ok, it's not really [Google](http://www.google.com): it's [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com). And it is responding but it is not able to process my request... ;-)




GMail is still beta, so it should not surprise me but... I'm so used to have Google available 24/7 that I was shocked when I received the error messages!  

IMHO, it shows the achievement of Google, it made me forget that I was accessing a remote site on Internet, I just knew that I could use their service everytime.




And it also reminded me to not completely trust Gmail while it's in beta and wait a little before switching to it as my webmail address.
