Finally, after almost 3 years running the same version of Wordpress for this weblog, I finally upgraded to [Wordpress 2.5][wordpress].
The [upgrade][wp-upgrade] went smoothly except for a permission problem at the end which is [documented in Wordpress forum][permission-topic].

Kudos to Wordpress team for releasing a web application which can upgrade a 3-year old version without any user intervention (almost...) while preserving all my content.
