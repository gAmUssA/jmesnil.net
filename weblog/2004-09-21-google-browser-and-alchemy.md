There's been some noise concerning an [eventual web browser from Google](http://www.nypost.com/business/30438.htm). 
Most bloggers bet on a [Gecko](http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/)-based HTML browser with features specific to [Google](http://www.google.com/) applications (such as Gmail, Picasa or Blogger). If what Google targets is a Google-branded [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox) with specific extensions, I'm highly unimpressed. We can already get most of this stuff quite conveniently and I don't see any added values. The Google brand won't be enough to make me switch from neither Firefox nor Safari.





However if you take into account [Adam Bosworth](http://www.adambosworth.net/), things may get more interesting. A Web Browser from Google would be a perfect fit for Adam's [Alchemy](http://developer.bea.com/technologies/soa/articles/soa_steinberg2.jsp) project (Alchemy is in fact a BEA project but Adam was the driving force behind it).





From that perspective, there seems to be a lot more potential for a Google Web Browser. One of the advantage I see is that it could simplify and make it possible to get a push-based Web that Adam [envisions](http://www.cs.ust.hk/vldb2002/VLDB2002-proceedings/papers/S01P01.pdf).
If you look at Gmail, Google has already started to push information to the browser, I almost never update Gmail web page because it is refreshed often enough that I got my mails already sitting in the Inbox. What's more, it is not a big "Refresh" with all the page being reloaded, they use [XmlHttpRequest](http://jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html) to only update the relevant portions of the page.




Frankly, I don't see all the potential that Alchemy can bring to the Web experience but I'd really like to learn more about it.




p.s.: Sometimes I feel that my weblog is dedicated only to Google! I definitely need to post some Java ramblings...
