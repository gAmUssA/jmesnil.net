Sun finally confirmed that Tiger is [J2SE 5.0](http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2004-06/sunflash.20040628.3.html).  

Frankly, I think the versioning of Java is quite absurd: you don't know if the number version refer to the edition, the platform or the language... I'd have preferred that Sun had chosen to go for _Java Standard Edition 5.0_ but






  * Sun doesn't care about my preferences


  * J2SE and J2EE are known brands and I believe there are some copyright issues related to it




Well, enough complaints for such small stuff... I've to keep some for Apple when they release Mac OS XI!




**Update: **Apparently, I'm not the only one who is confused, David Flanagan is also wondering about the [version numbers.](http://www.davidflanagan.com/blog/000038.html)
