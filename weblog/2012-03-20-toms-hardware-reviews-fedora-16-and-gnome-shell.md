[Fedora 16][fedora] is appropriate for my developer job but still not recommendable to friends and family.

I have installed Fedora 16 on my corporate laptop and like it better that the latest Ubuntu with Unity.
However, I still feel that both environments have regressed and are further away from Mac OS X for the user experience.

The foundations of Fedora 16 are solid, let's hope the next version will build on top of it to provide a useful and enjoyable UX.
