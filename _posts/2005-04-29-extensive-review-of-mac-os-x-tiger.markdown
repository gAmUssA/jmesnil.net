A extensive [review of Mac OS X Tiger](http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars) has been published on [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/).

The explanation of how metadata have been implemented and how Spotlight works under the hoods is the best I've seen so far.
I'm eager to try Spotlight but after reading that article and figuring out what can be done if users could apply metadata to file, I'm already looking forward to  Mac OS X 10.5 (lion?, wolverine?).
