I laughed out loud when I saw that [Brian](http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/) uses Ruby syntax as Java pseudo-code to describe a Web framework. It might be caused by too much exposure to [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)!  

Brian is right: his Ruby pseudo code is clearer than equivalent Java code. It is a testimony of Ruby expressiveness and, sadly, of the lack of it in Java.




As an aside, very interesting stuff Brian!
