> This is the story of a wonderful idea. Something that had never been done before, a moment of change that shaped the Internet we know today. This is the story of Flickr. And how Yahoo bought it and murdered it and screwed itself out of relevance along the way.

I had a sweet spot for [Flickr][flickr] when I started to shoot. I had a pro account for a few years but its site has lingered on without any innovation for a long time and I left it.

Flickr could have been YouTube, Facebook or Instagram. Once a thriving Web site with a enthusiastic community, it is now slowly fading into irrelevance. Sad story...
