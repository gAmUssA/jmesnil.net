I found this funny [list][remote-support] while playing with Apple Remote:

> To locate your devices router IP address, navigate to the following locations:
>
> * iPhone or iPod touch: Settings > Wi-Fi > [Network Name] 
> * Apple TV: Settings > General > Network
> * Mac OS X: Apple menu > System Preferences > Network
> * Windows XP: Start > Control Panel > Network Connections > [Network Connection Name] >     Properties > TCP/IP Properties
> * Windows Vista: Start > Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > View Status > Properties > TCP/IPv4 Properties

And I wonder why it took me hours every time I had to install or configure Windows!

To be fair, I've not checked how to locate the network settings in Windows CE but I bet for at least 7 or 8 submenus before finding it.

Next time someone asks me why I prefer to use a Mac than a PC, I'll show him this list.
