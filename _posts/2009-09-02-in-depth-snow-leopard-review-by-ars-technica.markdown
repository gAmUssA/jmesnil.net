As usual, the [review of Mac OS X 10.6 by Ars Technica][ars] is awesome and full of gold nuggets.

It gives a nice description of the changes under hood. I was particularly interested by:

* the explanation of [LLVM and Clang][clang] (and the code analyzer provided by Xcode 3.2)
* the addition of [Closures to C and C-derived languages][closures]
* the [design][gcd-design] and [implementation][gcd-implementation] of Grand Central Dispatch.

Now, I just need to find another pet project to play with all these new features.
