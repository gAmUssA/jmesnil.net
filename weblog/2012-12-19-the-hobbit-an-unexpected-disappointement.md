I watched &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; yesterday in 3D HFR and was disappointed by the experience. The 3D HFR is technically impressive but it prevented to immerse in the story.

[Vincent Laforet][laforet] provides a good explanation on _why_ 3D HFR was disengaging me from the movie. I could not better explain my disappointment.
Like him, I could watch it again in 2D to have a better visual experience but I did not enjoy the story enough.
This is not the Lord Of the Ring's &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;  (no Jar Jar Binks in sight) but the script could have been tighter and the characters more developped.

I did not think there was enough material in The Hobbit book for three movies. Watching the first one confirmed my opinion.
