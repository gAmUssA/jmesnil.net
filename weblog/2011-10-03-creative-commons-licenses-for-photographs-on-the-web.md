Interesting conversation between [James Duncan Davidson][duncan] and [Tim Bray][ongoing] about photos and licenses on the web.

* James wrote about its [reluctance][against] to use creative commons licenses for his professional photographs
* Tim then [explained][theology] how one of his photographs that he uploaded on Wikipedia (in a compressed size) under Creative Commons licenses was chosen to be a book cover and that he got paid for the full size version
* James then replied with additional [food for thought][wikipedia_photography]

At the moment, I upload [my photos on Flickr][myflickr] under an ["Attribution, Share Alike" Creative Commons license][ccl].
I do not take photos professionally but if people would be interested to use them in commercial products, I would like to get paid for their use.

Tim's proposal to use different licenses depding on the resolution is a good idea:

* use a creative commons licenses for low-to-moderate resolution and make them available liberally (on Wikipedia, Flickr, etc.)
* keep a more restrictive licenses on the full resolution
