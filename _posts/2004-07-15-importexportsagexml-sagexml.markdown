Following a blog of [Tim Bray](http://tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/14/FirefoxReader), I downloaded [Sage](http://sage.mozdev.org/), a Firefox news reader.




To evaulate it, I tried to import my [bloglines subscibtions](http://bloglines.com/public/jmesnil) under the OPML format but it failed.  

So I did the 101 test: I tried to import an OPML file that was exported by Sage and it also failed... 




At least, the good old drag'n'drop method is working.
