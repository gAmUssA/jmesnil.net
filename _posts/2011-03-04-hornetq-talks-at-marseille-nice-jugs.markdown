Next week, I will talk about [HornetQ][hornetq] and Messaging at the French mediterranean JUGs.

The first talk will be at [Marseille][mars] on Thursday 2011/03/10 and the second at [Nice][nice] on Friday 2011/03/11.
On the same days, Arnaud Simon from [Red Hat][redhat] will also present AMQP and Qpid.

My talks will be about HornetQ & the Web, how HornetQ embraces the Web and offers messaging features on top of Web technologies (REST, HTML5, etc.). It will also have a (brief) introduction to Messaging and JMS for developers who want to leverage messages for their application (Web-based or not).

See you there!
