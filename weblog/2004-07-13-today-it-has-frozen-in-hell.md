[Maven 1.0 has been released](http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/brett/archives/000786_ann_maven_10_released.html).




I haven't tried Maven since the RC1 (or RC2, it was months ago...) but I was really underwhelmed by it. To be fair, I'll give Maven 1.0 a try when one of the projects I follow move to it. But I'm not sold on the usefulness (or the relevance) of Maven compared to [Ant 1.6](http://ant.apache.org).
