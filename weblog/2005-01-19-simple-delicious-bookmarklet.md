It's so simple, it's not really a bookmarklet...





I added a bookmark in [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) which points to `http://del.icio.us/jmesnil/%s` and added a keyword `d` for it.  

So now when I want to go to my [del.icio.us java bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/jmesnil/java), I just have to type `d java` in the address bar to go to it.  

If I want to go to my [java and jms bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/jmesnil/java+jms), it's `d java+jms`.





&lt;disclaimer>  
I'm a total keyboard junkie. Too much emacs has definitely hurt my brain.  
&lt;/disclaimer>
