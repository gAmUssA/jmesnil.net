I've just finished to read ["Je Suis Legion"](http://www.humano.com/catalogue/fiche_catal.php?id=35160) ("I Am Legion" in the US, will be published by DC), a graphic novel from Les Humanoides Associes written by Fabien Nury illustrated  by John Cassaday (Planetary, Captain America, Astonishing X-Men) and colored by Laura Depuy (The Authority, Planetary).  

The story seems quite similar to the Carrion Comfort from Dan Simmons (from what I've been told of that book).  

The story takes place during the WWII and centers around psychic vampires.  

John Cassaday is at the top of his form. His pacing is very cinematic (like in Planetary). His drawings look even better on a oversized format and it makes me looking forward to the Absolute edition of Planetary (and a future hardcover of his run on the X-Men!).





There's a lot of introduction in that first volume but the premise is interesting and there's enough mistery to keep me waiting eagerly for the next two volumes of "Je Suis Legion". And the art is top notch.  

A recommended graphic novel.
