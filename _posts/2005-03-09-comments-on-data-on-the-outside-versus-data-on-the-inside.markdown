Fantastic paper from Pat Helland : [Data on the Outside Versus Data on the Inside](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dataoutsideinside.asp). In this paper, Pat gives a high-level overview of what SOA really means and all its implications.






His conclusions are not really groundbreaking:






  
  * use version dependent identifier

  
  * use XML for outside data

  
  * use SQL for inside data

  
  * use Objects for business logic




But what is great is the way he comes to that conclusion.





My favorite part is the introduction of a temporal notion in SOA.
I never realized before that using SOA has implications both on space _and_ time.
And the analogy between Newton and Einstein laws and RPC/2PC and SOA is simply brillant.  

This paper is a must for anyone interested in SOA without the hype surrounding the acronym (and not cluttered by a list of hundreds of WS-blablah).






I had the great pleasure to meet Pat Helland at [HPTS'03](http://research.sun.com/hpts2003/) and I learned a lot by listening to him (and [his songs](http://research.sun.com/hpts2003/presentations/Songs-For-HPTS-11.ppt)!). He has the most amazing quality to make complex things simple to understand (is there any better description for 2PC protocol than calling it the "unavailibility protocol"?)
