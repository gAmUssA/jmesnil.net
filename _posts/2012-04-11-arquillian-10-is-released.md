Integration testing is hard but _essential_. It is hard to track down integration issues (due to a misunderstanding between the callee and the caller's contract/API/service) but that's where *most* of bugs are located from my own experience.  
Unit tests with mocking does not help. Who cares about _my_ expectations about what a contrat/API/service provides *if it does not match the actual implementation.* Testing _in situ_ is the best way to check the actual behavior.

[Arquillian][arquillian] is a fantastic tool to help __write, execute and maintain integration tests__.

Congrates to the Arquillian team!
