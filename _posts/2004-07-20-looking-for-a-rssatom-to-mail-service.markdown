I'd like to receive subscribed RSS/Atom feeds in my webmail ,[Gmail](http://gmail.google.com), but I can't find such service.  

I found [Info Aggregator](http://rss.blogstreet.com) but it doesn't meet my requirements since it send mails to an IMAP server at BlogStreet.  

I also gave a try to [Bloglet](http://www.bloglet.com) but it refuses several RSS feeds which should work (at least they work on other aggregators).




Does one of you know such a service?
