I almost never go to Google home page these days: I use a bookmarklet to directly go to Google results page instead.
However with their [suggest](http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en) feature, Google has convinced me that it's worth it to go again to their homepage.
  

Now a RFE for Googlers: I'd like is to have this suggest feature in [GMail](http://gmail.google.com) when I do a mail search. I type `from:` in the search field and GMail should suggest me a list of senders. That'd be cool and useful...




Google is not the first web site to make extensive use of [XmlHttpRequest](http://jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html) but they show how it can be done to _enhance_ the web experience. As more developpers become aware of such functionalities, it will create a new breed of web applications which extend the web experience by embracing its principles rather than just mocking desktop applications within the browser.
