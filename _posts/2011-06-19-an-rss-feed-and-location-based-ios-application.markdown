[Cocoa With Love][love]'s Matt Gallagher:

> The purpose of this post is so that I will have a link to give people when they ask: how do I write an iOS application that pulls data from an RSS feed, displays it pretty and can put things on a map. I'll show you all of that and more as I rewrite my oldest iOS application from scratch: FuelView.

A recommended article which explains how to design and write a simple but _not too simple_ iOS application.
