Some highlights from [Greg Stein's keynote](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=106)

### The Apache Way ###

> * Communities first, code second  
> * Communities over individuals
> * Apache central to Open Source work but Eclipse is also gravitating to the center  
> * The license trend is going to the bottom

I found it quite interesting to see how  [Apache](http://apache.org) is organized and how  [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) compares to it.

For now, there is few overlaps between Apache and Eclipse communities but it has already started.  
For example, both communities now offer an [OSGi](http://osgi.org) implementation:

* [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) for Eclipse
* [Felix](http://incubator.apache.org/felix/) for Apache (in the incubator)

It it going to be interesting to see where things are going...
