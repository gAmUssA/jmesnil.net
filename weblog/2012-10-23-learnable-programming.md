Thought-provoking reading about learning to program. The essay is gorgeous with fantastic visuals to understand its arguments:

Being a server-side programmer during the day, I think the essay makes the wrong assumption that programs inherently have a visual representation that helps learn the language.  
What is the visual representation of an algorithm code other than a single number for each step? Not all algorithms have a visual interpretation like the [Fibonnacci sequence][golden-spiral]...  Maybe I am not thinking outside of the box and such a representation _do_ exist but I have not found it yet.

This essay makes a compelling argument that through the use of a graphic library (where the visual representation *is* the output of the program), we can learn the underlying programming language features (for loop, variable assignments) and abstractions (decomposition, abstraction).
