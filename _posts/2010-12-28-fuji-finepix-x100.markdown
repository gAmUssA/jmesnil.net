>Inspired by the beauty and form of classic cameras from the past, the FinePix X100 combines all the latest technical digital innovations in a beautiful, traditional chassis which oozes class and prestige.

The Fujifilm FinePix X100 turned heads at Photokina 2010 and it looks promising with its classic design and modern features.
I am looking forward to holding one and seeing through its viewfinder.

In the mean time, Fuji's advertisement web site is  worth reading to get some hindsights on the decisions made by the design team for the [lens][lens] and the [viewfinder][viewfinder].
