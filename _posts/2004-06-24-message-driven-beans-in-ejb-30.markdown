There's been a lot of discussions in the Java bloggosphere related to EJB 3.0 and its persistence mechanism.  
But I haven't seen anything on changes or enhancements to Message-Driven Beans...
I wonder if they'll follow the POJO way like the Entity Beans or if they'll remain the same. Well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
