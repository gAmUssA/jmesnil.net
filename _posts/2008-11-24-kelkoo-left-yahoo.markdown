Pierre Chappaz [reported ][chappaz] today that [Kelkoo][kelkoo] has been sold to a private-equity firm by [Yahoo!][yahoo] (Yahoo! bought it for 475M€ in 2004 and apparently sold it for less than 100M€)

I worked at Kelkoo for a short time in 2004-2005 after the acquisition. I made good friends and there is a bunch of smart people in this company.  
I'm sure they will rebound and innovate again now that they can focus on their own core business.


Good luck to my ex-colleagues!
