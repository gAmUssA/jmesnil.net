Very interesting triptych from [Brent Simmons][inessential] about Web publishing:

* [The Pummeling Pages](http://inessential.com/2011/11/22/the_pummeling_pages)
* [Pub Rules](http://inessential.com/2011/11/23/pub_rules)
* [Readable Future](http://inessential.com/2011/11/25/the_readable_future)

In other words, __content! content! content!__ (as in quality, not quantity).

It's a sad state for Web publishing when I need to use a mix of [Instapaper][instapaper], [Readability][readability], [Safari Reader][safari-reader] to have a sane reading experience without advertisement overload (and unfortunately, I know what an *interstitial* is...).
