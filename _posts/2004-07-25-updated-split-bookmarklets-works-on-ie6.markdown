Thanks to the many comments I had about the [split bookmarklets](http://www.jmesnil.net/weblog/2004/07/bookmarklet-to-split-html-document.html), I updated them and here they are:






  * [split horizontally in current window](javascript:document.write('<HTML><HEAD></HEAD><FRAMESET ROWS=\'50%,*\'><FRAME SRC=' + location.href + '><FRAME SRC=' + location.href + '></FRAMESET></HTML>');document.close();) -> drag to your bookmark folder



  * [split vertically in current window](javascript:document.write('<HTML><HEAD></HEAD><FRAMESET COLS=\'50%,*\'><FRAME SRC=' + location.href + '><FRAME SRC=' + location.href + '></FRAMESET></HTML>');document.close();) -> drag to your bookmark folder




the main changes are:






  * they work on on Internet Explorer 6 (many thanks to [this anonymous commenter](http://www.jmesnil.net/weblog/2004/07/bookmarklet-to-split-html-document.html#109047543233946689))


  * Firefox throbber is stopped once the frames loading is finished


  * the scrollbars appear only in the frames and not in Firefox (on some sites, it still does not work...)




I'm by no means a JavaScript wizard but I find quite amazing the difficulties to get such a simple javascript code to work on different browsers. With that little experience, I'm even more impressed by web applications using JavaScript like [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com) ([Oddpost](http://www.oddpost.com) is also worth to take a look but they made their job easier by only targeting Internet Explorer).
