I wanted to have a closer look to the [Enterprise Architectural Space ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag/html/entarch.asp) which is used to organize patterns on [patternshare.org](http://patternshare.org/).  

So I decided to download the PDF version to read it on my powerbook.






I really laughed out loud when I saw the system requirements to view the **PDF**:




> 
System Requirements  

* Supported Operating Systems: Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP






So I now know the truth: All your PDFs are belong to [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com)...  


At least, Microsoft was kind enough to let me browse their site with [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox)...
