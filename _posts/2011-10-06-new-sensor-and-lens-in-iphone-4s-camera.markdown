The improved camera is the single reason I will replace my iPhone 3GS by an iPhone 4S as soon as it is available.

It's too bad that [James Duncan Davidson announced they shut down the Daily Shoot](http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2011/10/dailyshoot_retired) when I finally have a good camera in my pocket all the time everyday.
