> Today we are introducing Crankshaft, a new compilation infrastructure for V8, Google Chromeâ€™s JavaScript engine. By using aggressive optimizations, Crankshaft dramatically improves the performance of compute-intensive JavaScript applications - often by more than a factor of two! This will give users a faster and more responsive experience loading web pages and applications built with complex JavaScript.

Since [node.js](http://nodejs.org) is based on V8, I wonder if it can leverage this new infrastructure to improve its performance.
