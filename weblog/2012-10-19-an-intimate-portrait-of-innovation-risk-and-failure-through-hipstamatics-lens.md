Fascinatic story about the demise of [Hipstamatic][hipstamatic].

There are many reasons why [Instagram][instagram] succeeded<a id="fnr1-2012-10-19" href="#fn1-2012-10-19"><sup>1</sup></a> and Hipstamatic did not. The article insists on the social aspect but that's not the only one.

> "The biggest problem with Hipstamatic is that [Lucas] didnâ€™t focus on Hipstamatic. What did Instagram do when lightning struck? They did nothing but focus on Instagram. What happened when Hipstamatic got successful? They made [separate products such as] Swankolab, Incredibooth, D Series, Family Album, Snap Magazine, and splintered off in so many different directions."  
> &mdash; <cite>Stuart Norrie,  former Hipstamatic designer</cite>

Focus. Focus. Focus.

1. <a id="fn1-2012-10-19"></a> At least in term of user base and engagement. Financially, how would have Instagram make any money other than being acquired by some bigger company?&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2012-10-19">&#8617;</a>
