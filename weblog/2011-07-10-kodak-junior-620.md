While talking about photography with my father, he told me that he still had an "old" camera from my grandfather and, lo and behold!, he showed me a folding camera: the [Kodak Junior 620][kodak].

I have not found a serial number and I don't know exactly which series it is but Kodak Junior 620 cameras were manufactured between 1935 and 1939 (depending on the series).

My grandfather's model has a Kodak Anastigmat f/7.7 lens and the shutter speeds are 1/25, 1/75, T, and B.
The camera is in pretty good shape (except for a bit of leather skin that I need to glue) and if I buy a 620 film roll, I could shoot like my grandfather did when he got it.  
I even found its [user manual][manual] to use it properly (I have never owned a camera with roll film).

What a family treasure to discover!
