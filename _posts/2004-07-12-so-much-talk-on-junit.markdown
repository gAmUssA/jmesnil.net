Given all the interviews, articles, blogs about JUnit (I won't even try to link to them...), I think they should replace the quote by Martin Fowler on the [JUnit Homepage](http://junit.org)




> "Never in the field of software development was so much owed by so many to so few lines of code".

> "Never in the field of software development was so much **talked** by so many about so few lines of code".




Yes, I use JUnit heavily but I don't think it's the main key aspect to good software development as so many would like us to believe.
