Something stroke me in Apple's press release where they announced the [OpenJDK project for Mac OS X][openjdk].

About Java, Bertrand Serlet, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering said: 

> “The best way for our users to always have the most up to date and secure version of Java will be to get it directly from Oracle.”

About Flash, Apple spokesperson Bill Evans told to [John Gruber][df] a few weeks ago: 

> "The best way for users to always have the most up to date and secure version is to download it directly from Adobe.”

Almost the same sentence to describe their approaches to both platforms.

Apple is clearly focusing on their own platforms and they don't want to support or maintain (a.k.a hear users complain about) Flash or Java.
