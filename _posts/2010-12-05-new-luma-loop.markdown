I use a first-generation Loop with my Nikon D7000 and it is a great product that I heartily recommend.  
With it, I can walk all day with the camera comfortably resting on my hip and hidden from sight by putting my hand on it.

The new version looks even better with a metallic connection instead of a plastic one:

They will soon offer to 1st-gen Loop customers a kit to upgrade to the new webbing and metal connection hardware of the new Loop. They can count on me to upgrade!

Luma's customer service is top notch: they once sent me an additional PodMount for free because the one I received did not meet their quality criteria even though it had no visible default. 

Great products + great service = happy customer.
