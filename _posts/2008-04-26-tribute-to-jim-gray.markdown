![Jim Gray](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b0/Jim_Gray_portrait,_1999.jpg)

I can't say it better than [Pat Helland][pat-helland]:

> Being at a conference like HPTS was very entertaining as I could 
look from across the room and see Jim march methodically 
through all the attendees, many he’d known for years and some he 
was just meeting.  I would smile because it was obvious they were 
getting the same kindness and curiosity that I so enjoyed.  I knew 
they would benefit from that attention. 

That is exactly what I felt when I met [Jim Gray][jim-gray] at [HPTS'03][hpts-03].
He made a strong and lasting impression on me with his amazing ability to explain complex things in simple terms.

I met a lot of so-called *architects* or *experts* who seem to take pride in being hard to understand (after all, if they could be understood by mere mortals, they wouldn't be experts...)

Jim Gray is the exact opposite:

> When strangers approached Jim, he had an uncanny ability to 
assess what they could understand and the level at which to 
explain the problem.  I’ve seen him take the most complex issues 
and dissect them into a framing that allowed a lay person to 
understand the gist of the problem and then, separately, dig int
the deepest and subtlest nuances with another more versed in the 
topic.

I really feel priviledged to have met Jim Gray.
