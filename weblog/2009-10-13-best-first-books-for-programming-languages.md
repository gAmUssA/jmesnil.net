These books are not necessarily the most complete references and they do not cover all features offered by the languages but I found that they gave me the best insight to understand and think with these languages.

One language I did not list is Java. I have used Java for so long that the last introduction book I read was for version 1.2. Which book would you recommend to learn Java?

1. <a id="fn1-2009-10-13"></a> This is more than just Objective-C but I found that learning Cocoa stuff really make the language shine.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2009-10-13">&#8617;</a>
2. <a id="fn2-2009-10-13"></a> I have not read <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/">Dive into Python 3</a> yet but I bet it is as good or even better than Dive into Python&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2009-10-13">&#8617;</a>
