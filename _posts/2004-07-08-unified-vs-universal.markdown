I'm reading the early draft of EJB 3.0 bits by bits and was quite amused by the **"universal context model"**. Doesn't it sound like the (in)famous JBoss' **"unified class loader"**?  

I wonder if the expert group will follow the same [version scheme](http://jroller.com/page/cpurdy/20040406#ucl_take_two)! ;-)
