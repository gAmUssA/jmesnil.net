I'll be presenting JBoss Messaging at [Irish Java Technologies Conference][ijtc] on January 7th & 8th 2009 at Dublin.
The [presentation][jbm-talk] will be mainly about JBoss Messaging 2.0 and what the team has cooked for this major release.

I am also looking forward to attend [Charles Nutter][headius]'s presentations about [JRuby][jruby-talk] and the [versatility of Java][versatility-talk].

See you at Dublin, the 7th & 8th January!
