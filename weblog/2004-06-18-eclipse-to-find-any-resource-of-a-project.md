Every time, I've to work on a new project, I spend lots of time to understand the structure of the projects and the location of the files.




[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) is a tremendous help for that: on my new project (thousands of JSP/XML files, dozens of CVS modules), when I use the web applications and I want the source of a given jsp, I use Eclipe `Navigate -> Open Resource... (Shift+Ctrl+R)` to locate the files corresponding to a given regexp (e.g. `*Summary.jsp`).




It's also a good shorcut to know when you have to work on big projects where browsing the project hierarchy is just too slow (and requires way too many clicks!).
