I'm a little disappointed by [Firefox 1.0](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) behavior on Fedora Core 2. It often crashes when I'm loading a batch of tabs in the background or if I'm Alt+Tabbing my windows (I already lost two blogs because of that...). It also freezes when I'm changing tabs.  

It's quite surprising that the stability and responsiveness of Firefox is so poor on my Fedora box because I also uses it extensively on Windows XP SP2 and Mac OS X and it really rocks (I even removed [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) from Mac OS X dock).




Firefox is a milestone for Open Source softwares. It is the first Open Source project that I installed on my parent's desktop and they happily use it. It has the potential to be the Open Source's poster child on the desktop the same way [Apache web server](http://httpd.apache.org) is on the servers. The [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org) deserves huge congratulations for their work. They have done a lots of mistakes in the past (mainly due to AOL) and more than once it seemed it was losing its focus. But with the release of Firefox 1.0 and the upcoming [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) 1.0, they are back on tracks and they really enhance the internet experience.




Never web browsing has been so fun! Well... as long as it's not on my fedora box!
