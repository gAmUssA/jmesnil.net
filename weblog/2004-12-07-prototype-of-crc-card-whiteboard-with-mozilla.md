Following my latest blog on the usefulness of a [CRC Card whiteboard based on Mozilla and XBL](http://www.jmesnil.net/weblog/2004/12/crc-card-based-extension-with-mozilla.html), I made a simple [prototype of such a whiteboard](http://jmesnil.net/xbl/crc.html) (works with Mozilla-based browsers only).  

I only prototyped the client side of the whiteboard. But if that whiteboard was coupled with Wiki software on the server (for version control mainly but also to annotate the cards if the need arises), it could be a _simple_ tool to communicate _simple_ designs between development teams which are geographically separated.




When I had some time, I'll try to integrate it with a Wiki.
