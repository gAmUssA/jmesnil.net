Yesterday, I discovered that [Firefox 1.0](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) on Mac OS X emulates a right click if I make a long click on the left (and only!) button. I didn't observe that behavior on Windows XP or Fedora Core 2. That's quite handy because I mostly use the trackpad on my PowerBook.  

That's great to see that Firefox on Mac OS X tries to provide the same user experience than [Aqua](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/aqua/). I'm looking forward to Firefox 1.x releases which should increase compliance to the [
Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/index.html) according to the new [roadmap](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/roadmap.html).




(Note to myself: I need to try [Camino](http://www.mozilla.org/products/camino/))
