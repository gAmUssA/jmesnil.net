As a follow up to my previous post, this is an interesting interview from [Dropbox][dropbox] founder, Drew Houston.

I use heavily Dropbox to synchronize contents and share documents between my iDevices and home/corporate laptop and it works without any problem.

I have not used their [APIs][api] but I hear it is great. Given the number of apps installed on my iPhone and iPad which uses it to share content, it is likely true.
