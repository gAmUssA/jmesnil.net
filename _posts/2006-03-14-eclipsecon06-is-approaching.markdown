[EclipseCon'06](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Home.do) is approaching and I haven't yet chosen the talks I want to attend.
There are so many things related to Eclipse which interest me:

* [OSGi/Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/)
* [RCP](http://www.eclipse.org/community/rcp.php "Rich Client Platform")
* [TPTP](http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/ "Test and Performance Tools Platform")
* [Eclipse Monkey](http://www.eclipse.org/dash/)

It'll be hard to choose between so many talks but I'm eagerly waiting to learn more about Eclipse Monkey.
Ward Cunningham and Bjorn Freeman-Benson envisioned it as *just* a [team tool](http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2006/03/monkey-on-loose.html) but Wayne Beaton is already
pushing it and uses it to [script a RCP application](http://wbeaton.blogspot.com/2006/03/scripted-eclipse-rcp.html).

Anyway, see you at [EclipseCon'06](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Home.do)!
And if you're interested by RCP and TPTP technology, I've a short talk about [integrating TPTP in a RCP application](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2006/Sub.do?id=198) which might interest you.
