In [Part 1](http://weblog.bignerdranch.com/?p=398):

> What is an "Objective-C Literal"? It's a chunk of code that references a specific Cocoa object, creating it if necessary. Objective-C has had literals for NSStrings since the beginning of time [...].  
> The new literals for NSNumbers, NSArrays, and NSDictionaries take a similar approach

In [Part 2](http://weblog.bignerdranch.com/?p=407):

> The new collection-access syntax is a welcome change, making it very convenient to dig into collections. What's even better is that our own classes can play in this world.  
> There are two flavors of convenient collection access: scalar indexing which is used by NSArray, and object indexing which is used by NSDictionary.

With these features, Objective-C becomes more expressive and takes the best syntactic sugars from dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. 
More expressiveness with less syntax noise.
