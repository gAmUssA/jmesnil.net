I continue to work my technique to shoot flowers with my Nikon D7000, 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6G and Hoya close up lens. Unsurprisingly, using my trusted [Giotto's Vitruvian][giottos] tripod helps...

The hidden goal of this post is to check that the photo appears correctly in overlay thanks to [Lightbox][lightbox2].
