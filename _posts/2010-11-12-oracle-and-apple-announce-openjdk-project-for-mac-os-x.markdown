> Oracle and Apple today announced the OpenJDK project for Mac OS X. Apple will contribute most of the key components, tools and technology required for a Java SE 7 implementation on Mac OS X, including a 32-bit and 64-bit HotSpot-based Java virtual machine, class libraries, a networking stack and the foundation for a new graphical client. OpenJDK will make Appleâ€™s Java technology available to open source developers so they can access and contribute to the effort.

That's the right move from Apple: they focus on their platforms (iOS, Mac OS X) and the Web (with WebKit) and let the OpenJDK community handles the Java platform.
