I noticed today that the [Middleware'05](http://middleware05.objectweb.org/) conference will be held in my sweet little town of Grenoble (France) from November 28th to December 2nd.




I'm looking forward to that one. It'll be a great opportunity to talk again will all the great guys I met at [HPTS'03](http://research.sun.com/hpts2003/).
