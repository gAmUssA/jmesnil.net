Congratulations to the [JOnAS](http://jonas.objectweb.org) team and too all [ObjectWeb](http://www.objectweb.org) guys!  

JOnAS certification was made possible by a collective effort from a lot of ObjectWeb projects including the two I worked on: [JORAM](http://joram.objectweb.org) (for JMS) and [JOTM](http://jotm.objectweb.org) (for JTA).




It's a huge achievement and it will definitely help to broaden JOnAS adoption and other ObjectWeb technologies ([C-JDBC](http://c-jdbc.objectweb.org) and [ASM](http://asm.objectweb.org) are really cool).
