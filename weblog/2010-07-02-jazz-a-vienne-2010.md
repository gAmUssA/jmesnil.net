Yesterday, Joe Cocker was at Jazz a Vienne and it was thrilling to listen to him:

I love going to Jazz a Vienne: the location is spectacular, the sound is great and the artists are always top notch!

I was annoyed that the security did not let me keep my camera. I wanted to take some nice pictures with my 70-300mm and all I had was my iPhone and some low-quality HDR snapshots...
