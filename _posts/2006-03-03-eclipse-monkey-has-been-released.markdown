From its [Web page](http://www.eclipse.org/dash/index.php):
> Eclipse Monkey is a dynamic scripting tool for the automation of 
> routine programming tasks. Monkey scripts are little Javascript

I downloaded it and installed it on Eclipse 3.1.1 and it is
promising.  
It seems inspired a lot by [greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/)
and I'd like to see what kind of scripts the Eclipse community will create.

A first script I'd really like to get is to transform code comments like `//BUG 12345` into a clickable URL
to our bug tracker.

A concrete example of what can be done with Eclipse Monkey is Wayne Beaton's [Flickr script](http://wbeaton.blogspot.com/2006/03/scripting-eclipse-rcp-with-javascript.html)

Kudos to [Ward Cunningham & Bjorn Freeman-Benson](http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/)
