Interesting move from Apple for the release of Xcode 4: [free][free] for registered iOS and Mac developer and $4.99 / 3.99&euro; on the [App Store][appstore].

On my spare time, I have been using the various beta releases of Xcode 4 for Mac/iOS development  and I really enjoy the streamlined experience.

For Java development, I use [eclipse][eclipse] that I know from the inside out after doing a lot of plug-in development some years ago.
With every release, eclipse has become more powerful but also more complex and I have not noticed an increase in my productivity.

With Xcode 4 (single window, built-in Interface Builder, Git support with Time-Machine UI, iTunes-like status), Apple developers have managed to simplify the UI, streamline the experience *and* increase my productivity.  
Kudos!
