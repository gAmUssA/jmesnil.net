[__Update__: thumbs up to Apple for listening and [dropping the NDA][nda-drop]]

Learning that [Apple extends NDA to rejection letters][nda] on the same day that the first phone with  [Google Android][android] is launched sends a bad message to developers hesitating between the two platforms. 

[PC Vs Mac circa 1990, all over again?][danlyons] We know how it ended for Apple.

When I think about it, there is more lessons to learn from the Macintosh than the iPod to know what lies ahead of the iPhone.
Apple needs developers to make a long term success of the iPhone. They provide a good SDK to create applications and the platform is really good. However, it they continue to prevent open communication (through the SDK NDA) and reject applications without a well-defined policy, they will scare a lot of developers from building on this platform and send them into Android's arms.
