While I was offline, Red Hat announced the Open Source release of its Platform as a service (PaaS).
[Open Shift Origin][origin] will be the Open Source upstream project for [Open Shift][openshift] in the same way that [Fedora][fedora] and [JBoss AS7][as7] are the upstream projects for [Red Hat Enterprise Linux][rhel] and [JBoss EAP6][eap6].

I have played a little with OpenShift and it is very easy to use and deploy. I ported a small application using [node.js][nodejs] and [Redis][redis] to it in a matter of minutes (I will write about it in  my next post).
