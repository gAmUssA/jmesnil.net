[Brian McCallister][brian] writes about his introduction to [Go][go]:

> I know of folks having great success with Go, and it offers a lot that I want (native code, UNIX friendly, higher level then C, lower level then Python or Ruby, garbage collected, strongly typed, good performance, good concurrency support, etc), so I tried to stop programming my way, and start programming Goâ€™s way.

I have read both good and bad things about Go. I need to use it to make my own opinion about it.  

I am pondering which new programming language to learn in 2013 and it will either be Go or [Ceylon][ceylon].
